# BioThings Explorer

## Introduction

This is the development repo for the web service of BioThings Explorer. This tool aims at helping users querying and linking results from a variety of biomedical relevant APIs through one interface. The project is funded by the NCATS Translator project.

### Revelant Concepts

1. BioLink Model

   [The BioLink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) defines a high level datamodel of biological entities (genes, diseases, phenotypes, pathways, individuals, substances, etc) and their associations. BioThings Explorer restructures outputs from different APIs into the data model defined by BioLink, so that they can be easily connected and queried.

2. SmartAPI

   [SmartAPI](https://smart-api.info) aims to maximize the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of web-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Rich metadata is essential to properly describe your API so that it becomes discoverable, connected, and reusable. BioThings Explorer takes advantage of the rich metadata information described in SmartAPI and create a meta knowledge graph, allowing BioThings Explorer to autonomously query a distributed knowledge graph. The distributed knowledge graph is made up of biomedical APIs that have been annotated with semantically-precise descriptions of their inputs and outputs.
